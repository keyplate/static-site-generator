## Static Site Generator

This project is a simple static site generator that compiles static .html pages from .md (Markdown) files. 
While there are many automated solutions available, the main goal of this project is to revisit Java basics and understand the underlying processes typically hidden behind automated build tools.

### Build

```bash
$ chmod +x "build.sh"
$ ./build.sh
```

### Test
